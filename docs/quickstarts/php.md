# PHP

To deploy your PHP app on FL0, follow the guide below to configure your codebase correctly.

### Minimal PHP app

Add a new file `index.php` into an empty repository, and deploy this repository with FL0:

```php title="/index.php"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>FL0</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <?php
      print("Welcome to FL0");
    ?>
  </body>
</html>
```
